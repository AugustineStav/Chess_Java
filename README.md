# Chess_Java

This Java program simulates a chess board. Two players take turns as White and Black team. User input is given as the coordinates of the piece to be moved and coordinates of destination (to move or capture a piece at that location).  The handling of draws will be improved. The stalemate checker needs to be tested thoroughly and expanded. For example, the draw condition "Insufficient Material for Checkmate" will be implemented (for, in the case of king vs. king and bishop).
